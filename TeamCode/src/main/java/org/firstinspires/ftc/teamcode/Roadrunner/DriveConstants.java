     * Note from LearnRoadRunner.com:
     * The velocity and acceleration constraints were calculated based on the following equation:
     * ((MAX_RPM / 60) * GEAR_RATIO * WHEEL_RADIUS * 2 * Math.PI) * 0.85
     * This is capped at 85% because there are a number of variables that will prevent your bot from actually
     * reaching this maximum velocity: voltage dropping over the game, bot weight, general mechanical inefficiencies, etc.
     * However, you can push this higher yourself if you'd like. Perhaps raise it to 90-95% of the theoretically
     * max velocity.
     * Just make sure that your bot can actually reach this maximum velocity. Path following will be detrimentally
     * affected if it is aiming for a velocity not actually possible.
     *
     * The maximum acceleration is somewhat arbitrary and it is recommended that you tweak this yourself based on
     * actual testing. Just set it at a reasonable value and keep increasing until your path following starts
     * to degrade.
     *
     * Maximum Angular Velocity is calculated as: maximum velocity / trackWidth * (180 / Math.PI) but capped at 360°/s.
     * You are free to raise this on your own if you would like. It is best determined through experimentation.
